        <h1>Our Story</h1>
        <p>Our journey began many years ago with two brothers and an upright piano. Along the way was lots of practice, lessons, and more practice. Then came the recitals and piano competitions. We wanted to do more with our music -- we wanted to share it with others. Eventually we found ourselves playing in hospitals for patients and health care workers, and loved it. That led to routine performances in local nursing homes and then to Kids for Kindness!</p>
